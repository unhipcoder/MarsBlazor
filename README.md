# MarsBlazor
Blazor project exploring the surface of Mars with Curiosity using the NASA Api 

## The Idea 
Create a slick client-side SPA using Blazor and make it look nothing like the standard Blazor samples.   

Interface where the user can select a period on the Mars rover Curiosity's timeline, switch cameras and view images from the NASA Api https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos

Main abojective is to produce a great looking UX/UI
